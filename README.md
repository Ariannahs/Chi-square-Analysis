## Methods to test the correlation between categorical variables or between categorical and numerical variables:

For categorical variables, use **Chi-square Analysis**:  
If we assume that two variables are independent, the values of the contingency table for those variables should be evenly distributed. Then we check the distance between the actual value and the uniformity.  
Null Hypothesis H0: variables are independent(uniform distribution).
If p value < 0.05, it means the two variables are not independent (correlated).  

For numerical variables, use **One-Way ANOVA Analysis**:   
We calculated in-group variance and intra-class intra-group variance, and then compared them.  
If p value < 0.05, it means the two variables are not independent (correlated).
